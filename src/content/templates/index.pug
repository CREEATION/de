  p Hello! My name is Thomas Creeten and I welcome you to my website! 🐢
  p If you're hearing this, you're probably unable to see what I'd love you to be able to see.
  p You might just wish to skip my blabber, in which case you'd simply press Tab and go explore yourself. 🕵️‍♀️
  p I've crafted this website as sort of a text adventure, so you'll be able to navigate everything with a keyboard.
  p(aria-label="For people looking at the source code")
    | The above is probably not what you were looking for. Nevertheless, I’m currently available for hire so feel free to continue lurking around. 👀
