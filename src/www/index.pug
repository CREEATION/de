    Hello! My name is Thomas Creeten and I welcome you to my website! 🐢
    If you’re hearing this, you’re probably unable to see what I’d love you to be able to see.
    You might just wish to skip my blabber, in which case you’d simply press Tab and go explore yourself. 🕵️‍♀️
    I’ve crafted this website as sort of a text adventure, so you’ll be able to navigate everything without a mouse.

  p(aria-label="For people looking at the source code")
    | The above is probably not what you were looking for. Nevertheless, I’m currently available for hire so feel free to continue lurking around. 👀

    | #[span(class="text:yellow") Hello] fellow human,
    br
    | my name is #[span(class="text:green filter:wash") Thomas] and #[span(class="text:blue filter:wash") I write code].

  p Over the years I’ve developed a focus on User Interfaces and Interactions, trying to eliminate bad #[a(href="#", class="text:stamp") user experience] along the way.
  p Follow me.
